This means that most accepted moves are displacement moves, and the exchange move is not being accepted. This is because we attempt to place oxygen atoms everywhere in the unit cell, which is not desirable.</p> <p>Instead, we want to attempt moves only close to the nanoparticle where the atoms can bind and have enough excess chemical potential to be accepted. To do this, we can customize the <code>check_move</code> attribute of the <code>ExchangeMove</code> to only accept moves that are close to the nanoparticle. Below is an example of how to do this:</p> <pre><code>...\n\n\ndef check_move(context: ExchangeContext) -&gt; bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the move can be performed based on the center of mass distance.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    bool\n        True if the move can be performed, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    atoms_about_to_be_placed = atoms[mc.context._moving_indices]\n    com_distance = (\n        atoms_about_to_be_placed.positions  # type: ignore[shape]\n        - atoms[atoms.symbols == \"Pt\"].get_center_of_mass()  # type: ignore[shape]\n    )\n\n    return not bool(np.any(np.linalg.norm(com_distance, axis=1) &gt; 8.0))\n\n\nmc.moves[\"default_exchange_move\"].move.check_move = check_move\n</code></pre> <p>In this way, the exchange move will attempt to place oxygen atoms only within a certain distance. If the distance is too large, it will retry a placement. This is done <code>move.max_attempts</code> times, which is set to 10,000 by default. If the move can't find a suitable position after all attempts, it will be rejected.</p> <p>We also change the <code>accessible_volume</code> attribute of the <code>GrandCanonical</code> class to reflect the volume where the oxygen atoms can be placed. This is important for the acceptance rate calculation.</p> <pre><code>mc.accessible_volume = np.pi * 3 / 4 * (8.0**3)\n</code></pre> <p>After these changes, we can run the simulation again and get the following output:</p> <pre><code>Step Epot[eV] AcptRate Natoms\n0 -218.0509 0.000 44\n1 -218.0484 0.636 44\n2 -218.1835 0.636 44\n3 -218.3500 0.636 44\n4 -218.3445 0.545 44\n5 -218.3713 0.636 44\n6 -218.5544 0.432 44\n7 -223.5220 0.636 45\n8 -223.6393 0.545 45\n9 -223.6890 0.591 45\n10 -223.7481 0.545 45\n11 -224.1059 0.614 45\n12 -224.1784 0.636 45\n13 -224.2668 0.614 45\n14 -224.2314 0.545 45\n15 -224.3243 0.568 45\n16 -228.7678 0.568 46\n</code></pre> <p>We can see the number of atoms is increasing, indicating that the exchange move is being accepted and oxygen atoms are being placed in the system. Still, we might want to increase the acceptance rate further by using <code>quansino</code>'s flexibility and creating a custom criteria for the exchange move that optimizes the system before running the criteria:</p> <pre><code>from quansino.mc.criteria import GrandCanonicalCriteria\n\n\nclass GrandCanonicalMinimizationCriteria(GrandCanonicalCriteria):\n    \"\"\"\n    Acceptance criteria for Monte Carlo moves in the grand canonical (\u03bcVT) ensemble with minimization.\n\n    This criteria extends the GrandCanonicalCriteria to include minimization of the system's energy.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, optimizer: BFGSLineSearch, run_kwargs: dict[str, Any]) -&gt; None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the GrandCanonicalMinimizationCriteria.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.optimizer = optimizer\n        self.run_kwargs = run_kwargs\n\n    def evaluate(self, *args, **kwargs) -&gt; bool:\n        \"\"\"\n        Evaluate the acceptance criteria for a Monte Carlo move with minimization.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        *args\n            Positional arguments.\n        **kwargs\n            Keyword arguments.\n\n        Returns\n        -------\n        bool\n            True if the move is accepted, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.optimizer.reset()\n\n        self.optimizer.run(**self.run_kwargs)\n        return super().evaluate(*args, **kwargs)\n\n\nmc.moves[\"default_exchange_move\"].criteria = GrandCanonicalMinimizationCriteria(\n    optimizer=BFGSLineSearch(atoms, logfile=None),  # type: ignore[ase]\n    run_kwargs={\"fmax\": 0.05, \"steps\": 100},\n)\n</code></pre> <p>This criteria will run a minimization of the system before evaluating the acceptance criteria, which greatly helps in finding a suitable position for the oxygen atoms. This can be seen in the logger output:</p> <pre><code>Step Epot[eV] AcptRate Natoms\n0 -218.0509 0.000 44\n1 -227.8073 0.682 45\n2 -233.6502 0.568 46\n3 -245.7113 0.682 48\n4 -258.2237 0.659 50\n5 -276.5334 0.614 53\n6 -292.4062 0.614 56\n7 -310.4333 0.568 59\n8 -306.1936 0.545 58\n9 -324.0663 0.455 61\n10 -330.0961 0.591 62\n11 -341.8466 0.705 64\n12 -341.7592 0.591 64\n13 -356.9901 0.591 66\n14 -367.7151 0.614 68\n15 -379.8796 0.591 70\n16 -397.0771 0.523 73\n</code></pre> <p>This approach resembles a basin-hopping algorithm and unfortunately does not respect detailed balance. However, it can be useful in some cases where the acceptance rate is low and the system is not converging. A middle ground can be found by fixing every other atom and only optimizing the position of the oxygen atoms being placed, which is left as an exercise for the reader (or can be found in the <code>examples</code> directory of the <code>quansino</code> repository).</p>"},{"location":"documentation/logging.html","title":"Logging","text":"<p>Quansino differs from ASE for logging in that it does not make use of its own logging module:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>Logger</code> class is used to create custom loggers that are flexible and can be configured to log any kind of information.</li> <li>The <code>TrajectoryObserver</code> class only supports <code>extxyz</code> (<code>xyz</code>) format to log atomic trajectories.</li> <li>There is an additional <code>RestartObserver</code> class that can be used to log the entire simulation state at regular intervals for future restarts.</li> </ul> <p>All these classes are located in the <code>quansino.io</code> module and will be described in detail in the following sections.</p>"},{"location":"documentation/logging.html#the-logger-class","title":"The <code>Logger</code> class","text":"<p>The <code>Logger</code> class is designed to create custom loggers that can be configured to log various types of information.
